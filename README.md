# PRODIGY_DS_01 - Task 1: Data Visualization

## 🚀 Internship Track:
Data Science - Prodigy InfoTech

## 📌 Task Description:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## 📊 What I Did:
I used the Titanic dataset (from Seaborn) to create a **bar chart** showing the distribution of passengers across different travel classes (`Pclass`). The plot was built using **Seaborn** and styled for clarity.

## 🧠 What I Learned:
- Creating bar plots using Seaborn
- Visualizing categorical data
- Enhancing plots with titles, colors, and labels
